#### Creational
- create objects for you
- Builder
- Abstract Factory: lets you produce family of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Factory: Provides an interface to create objects in superclass, but subclasses create different types of objects.
- Singleton: ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.
- Prototype: used to clone objects without being dependent on their classes.

#### Behavioral
- focus on inter-object communication patterns
- Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Iterator, Observer
- Chain of Responsibility and Visitor
- Memento, State, Template
- Strategy: lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class and make their objects interchangeable.

#### Structural
- focus on object composition and interfaces
- Adapter, Bridge, Composite
- Decorator and Flyweight
- Facade and Proxy
